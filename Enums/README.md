# Focus on Enums

Many program languages support a concept called Enumerated Types or better known as Enums. An Enum is a set of named constants that can be used as a type. C# does also support Enums, and the construct is easy to use. But Enums have a few pitfalls that are not obvious and can lead to unexpected behavior. Not obvious is also, that C# supports two different kinds of Enums with slight differences.
